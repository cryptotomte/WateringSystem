# Documentation Cleanup and Architecture Simplification - Completion Report

**Date:** June 9, 2025  
**Project:** WateringSystem v2.2  
**Task:** Clean up documentation and simplify to 2-domain architecture

## Summary

Successfully completed comprehensive cleanup and simplification of the WateringSystem project documentation and hardware specifications. Transitioned from complex 3-domain isolation to practical 2-domain optical isolation optimized for greenhouse automation.

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Documentation Cleanup
- **Removed 18 duplicate/outdated files** from docs directory
- **Retained 7 core documents**: architecture.md, hardware.md, release-notes.md, requirements.md, safety.md, testing.md, user-guide.md
- **Eliminated versioned variants** (v2.1.1, v2.2, etc.) for single source of truth

### ✅ Architecture Simplification  
- **Updated hardware.md**: Complete rewrite for 2-domain system with 3108 SEK BOM cost
- **Updated architecture.md**: Simplified optical isolation strategy documentation
- **Updated README.md**: v2.2 specifications with cost-effective design focus
- **Updated release-notes.md**: Clear explanation of simplification rationale

### ✅ Code Consistency
- **Removed TMR 1-1215 references**: No expensive DC-DC converter required
- **Removed MIKROE-4156 references**: Direct SP3485EN transceiver implementation
- **Updated SP3485ModbusClient.h**: Corrected comments for simplified architecture
- **Verified PowerDomainManager**: Already configured for 2-domain system

## Architecture Comparison

| Aspect | Previous (v2.1.1) | Simplified (v2.2) | Improvement |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Domains** | 3 (ESP32, RS485_ISO, SENSOR) | 2 (ESP32, FIELD) | 33% simpler |
| **Isolation** | Optical + Ground (6.5kV) | Optical only (5kV) | Adequate for use case |
| **BOM Cost** | ~6000 SEK | 3108 SEK | 48% reduction |
| **Components** | TMR 1-1215 + MIKROE-4156 | FOD817BSD only | Fewer failure points |
| **PCB Complexity** | Isolation gaps required | Standard layout | Easier manufacturing |

## Cost Analysis

### Removed Expensive Components
- **TMR 1-1215 DC-DC Converter**: ~1500 SEK saved
- **MIKROE-4156 RS485 Module**: ~650 SEK saved  
- **Complex PCB Requirements**: Significant manufacturing cost reduction
- **Additional Optocouplers**: Minimal cost (~200 SEK total)

### **Total Savings: ~50% BOM cost reduction**

## Technical Validation

### Safety Verification
- ✅ **5kV optical isolation** adequate for enclosed greenhouse systems
- ✅ **Single ground plane** suitable for 12V battery applications
- ✅ **IP65 enclosure** provides environmental protection
- ✅ **FOD817BSD specifications** meet isolation requirements

### Functional Verification  
- ✅ **RS485 communication** maintained via optical isolation
- ✅ **Sensor functionality** preserved (NPK, pH, EC, moisture)
- ✅ **Power management** simplified but effective
- ✅ **Web interface** unchanged and fully functional
