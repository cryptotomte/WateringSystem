## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cryptotomte/WateringSystem.git
cd WateringSystem
```

2. Install PlatformIO (if not already installed):
```bash
pip install platformio
```

### Windows PowerShell Commands
On Windows systems, PlatformIO may not be in PATH. Use these commands:

```powershell
# Build project
& "C:\Users\crypt\.platformio\penv\Scripts\pio.exe" run --environment wateringsystem

# Upload to device  
& "C:\Users\crypt\.platformio\penv\Scripts\pio.exe" run --target upload --environment wateringsystem
```

3. Build and upload the firmware:
```bash
platformio run --target upload
```

4. Upload the file system (for web interface):
```bash
platformio run --target uploadfs
```

## Usage
1. **Initial Setup**
   - Power on the device
   - Connect to the WiFi network "WateringSystem-XXXX"
   - Navigate to 192.168.4.1 in your web browser
   - Follow the setup wizard to configure your home WiFi network

2. **Web Interface**
   - Access the web interface by navigating to the IP address of the device
   - Monitor current environmental and soil conditions
   - Configure watering schedules and thresholds
   - View historical data and system logs

3. **OTA Updates**
   - Access the update page at http://[device-ip]/update

## Safety
The WateringSystem interfaces with both water and electricity. Important safety considerations:
- All electrical components must be properly isolated from water
- Use waterproof enclosure for outdoor installations
- Include proper grounding for lightning protection in outdoor installations
- Power supply must be isolated and conform to safety standards

For complete safety information, see [Safety Documentation](docs/safety.md).
